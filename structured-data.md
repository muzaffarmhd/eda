To apply statistics and get and inference, raw, unstructured data must be converted in a structured format. In order for us to do that, we must understand what types of data and in what format we recieve.

Key terms for Data Types:
1. Continuous: Data that might take any value in an interval.
2. Discrete: Data that can take a value only at regular intervals, and can take only integer values.
3. Categorical: Data that can take any value from a defined set of categories.
4. Binary: One of two types
5. Ordinal data: Categorical but with hierarchial order/ranking


There are two basic types of structured data: numeric and categorical.

Numeric: a. Continuous and b. Discrete

Categorical: Categorical data takes only a fixed set of values, such as a type of TV screen (plasma, LCD, LED, etc.) or a state name (Alabama, Alaska, etc.). Binary data is an important special case of categorical data that takes on only one of two values, such as 0/1, yes/no, or true/false. Another useful type of categorical data is ordinal data in which the
categories are ordered; an example of this is a numerical rating (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
